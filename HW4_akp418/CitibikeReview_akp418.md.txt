Hi Mona(nm2773,nmonarizqa),

I went through your Citibike assignment and would like to give you feedback regarding the same.

On the whole you've structured the thought very well. Good job on that. I'm pretty impressed.

Feedback:

# 1) Idea and Hypothesis:
You're idea and hypotheses(null and alternate) are clear and valid.

You started of with the idea of relating the age factor with the ability to take longer trips. But then linking it to the birth year sort of restricted your analysis temporally. Instead if you could have categorized the younger and older populations by a specific age category (< 30years & >= 30years ) your analysis could be extended to larger time lines and even analysed temporally.


#  2) Data processing:

You've done a great job in cleaning the data and deriving other required information(like length of trips) etc. I learnt a lot from it.

Even though you stated your hypothesis on the basis of young and old population you shifted your focus to millenials(though in this case it is more or less same). I believe Millenials are population born between 1980 & 2000 only.

# 3) Plots:

The plots are very clean and clear.

In terms of the message that you are trying to give, I believe another type of plot would have been something like the image attached in your repository. Which would convey the whole message in one graph.


# Suggested Test:

If you would go for two categorical IV's like >30years and <=30 years, I would suggest the T-test for this hypothesis.

But if you would extend it to more than two categories like (20-30 years, 30-40 years, 40-50 years etc.) or (1950-60, 1960-70, 1970-80 etc.) you would have to use the ANOVA test.
