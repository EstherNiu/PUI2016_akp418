## Assignment : 1

- I have forked Nurvirta's repository and written the comments in CitibikeReview_akp418.md file in her HW3 directory.

## Assignment : 2

- I worked with Vishwajeet and Aaron on this assignment.
- Aaron & Vishwajeet have searched for the papers. I helped them with the understanding of the question and completing the table.


| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | _Ha_ |alpha | link to paper **|

MANOVA	| 2(1/1), Adults/Children(4 to 8 year old) | Categorical | 3, three time-varying optic flow patterns (translation, rotation, and radial expansion/contraction)| Continuous | Not Applicable here (N/A) | NIL (N/A) | 	Structured patterns of global visual motion called optic flow provide crucial information about an observer's speed and direction of self-motion and about the geometry of the environment - the developing brain segregates the processing of optic flow pattern from speed and that an adult-like pattern of neural responses to optic flow has begun to emerge by early to middle childhood | Neither Children nor Adults show widespread responses to modulations of motion coherence at the second harmonic that are not selective for pattern or speed  | Both children and adults show widespread responses to modulations of motion coherence at the second harmonic that are not selective for pattern or speed | 0.05 | [Children's Brain Responses to Optic Flow Vary by Pattern Type and Motion Speed](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157911) |

## Part - II (Choosing one from the Second Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Theory being stated | Question to be answered | _H0_ | _Ha_ |alpha | link to paper **|

PATH ANALYSIS	| 2(1-1), (1 - two different cultures and languages) - (1 - professional actors and emotion inference by na√Øve listeners) | Continuous | 4, four emotion families (fear, anger, happiness, and sadness | Continuous | N/A Here (NIL) | N/A Here (0) | Use a comprehensive path model of vocal emotion communication, encompassing encoding, transmission, and decoding processes, to empirically model data sets on emotion expression and recognition | The statistical models generated show that more sophisticated acoustic parameters need to be developed to explain the distal underpinnings of subjective voice quality percepts that account for much of the variance in emotion inference, in particular voice instability and roughness| Does not confirm the central role of arousal in vocal emotion | Confirm the central role of arousal in vocal emotion communication, the utility of applying an extended path modeling framework is demonstrated by the identification of unique combinations of distal cues and proximal percepts carrying information about specific emotion families, independent of arousal | 0.02 | [Path Models of Vocal Emotion Communication](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136675) |

## Assignment : 3

- I have read all the tests and concepts myself. I worked with Achilles on this Assignment.


## Assignment : 4

-Vishwajeet and Achilles have helped me on this assignment
